            <span>Sharon Radisch, the NYC and Paris-based photographer, creative director and artist, circumvented a traditional path to a career in the arts. She initially graduated with a biology/pre-med degree before moving to Paris to study the French language. Intending to stay for six months, Sharon remained in France for three years while completing a master's degree in biology and cellular physiology. This unique educational background lent Sharon an eye for abstraction. As she witnessed the cohesive nature of organic life, she felt drawn to the minute mechanisms of cells in isolation. For several years, Sharon applied this interest in interaction to her work in the medical field. After long days in laboratories, she sought solace in creative practice and began assembling sculptural still lifes to photograph. Soon her creative practice blossomed into a full-time career as her unique compositions resonated with a growing social media following. Now with over nine years of professional photography experience, Sharon sees a parallel between her biological and artistic work. Just as organisms depend on individual interactions between cells, Sharon’s sculptural still lifes emulate the organic— integrating disparate elements to compose an unexpected harmony. <br><br>
                Today, Sharon’s fashion photography and still lifes have captured the attention of luxury brands, with clients including Chanel, La Prairie, Trudon, La Mer and Bergdorf Goodman. She has also worked with publications such as Architectural Digest, Harper's Bazaar, The New York Times T Magazine, Cereal, and Conde Nast Traveller. With a wide array of work— spanning fashion, travel, still life, and interior design— Sharon’s fine art and commercial photography are seen as indistinguishable. No matter her subject or medium, Sharon approaches each project as a study of shape and interplay, texture and tension. </span>
